Slime 

Each slime has the following:
	Attributes
		column - The x location on the map matrix
		row - The y location on the map matrix
		center_x - The x location on the render screen
		center_y - The y location on the render screen
		max_health - A maximum value based on level
		current_health - When health = 0 kill off the slime
		attack - A set value based on level, upon success the targets health is reduced by attack value, 
			 this slime will be healed by a small aboutn still based on attack, 1 xp will be earned
		xp - Will be used to calculate level using an exponential equaiton (possible level = roundup(xp^2 - 2*xp + 1))
		level - a number from 1 to 10 that is used to dictate the slimes attributes and end game value
		merge_ready - a boolean for ready to merge, is set to false at the beginning of its turn
	Commands
		Move
			Left
			Right
			Up
			Down
		Bite
			Bite - Check the spaces surrounding the slime for an enemy or plant. The first one found will be attacked
			Bite.Up - Check the square in the designated direction, enemy slime or plant in that direction will be attacked
			Bite.Down - Check the square in the designated direction, enemy slime or plant in that direction will be attacked
			Bite.Left - Check the square in the designated direction, enemy slime or plant in that direction will be attacked
			Bite.Right - Check the square in the designated direction, enemy slime or plant in that direction will be attacked
		Split
			Split - (available at level 5) reduce slime to xp equal to rounddown(previousxp/2.2) and another slime is created in 
				a random adjacent empty square, there is possible a chance for the extra slime to fail in being formed
		Merge
			Merge - slime's merge_ready value is set to true, then checks for any adjacent slimes with merge_ready set to true, 
				if one is found then this slime xp is set to rounddown(1.5*(sum of both slimes xp)) and the adjacent slime 

				is killed
Each plant has the following:
	Attributes
		column - The x location on the map matrix
		row - The y location on the map matrix
		center_x - The x location on the render screen
		center_y - The y location on the render screen
		max_health - A maximum value based on level
		current_health - When health = 0 kill off the plant
		level - a number from 1 to 20 that is used to dictate the plants attributes, has a chance each turn to level up with 
			decreasing chance at higher levels, every time a plant levels up half of its max health is returned to it
		seed_ready - available at level 20, every turn the plant checks if it is level 20, if it is it has a small chance to drop a 
			     level 1 plant in a random empty adjacent square

Gameplay
	Plants
		Every turn each plant has a chance to grow to the next level, and all level 20 plants have a chance to seed a new plant in 
		an empty adjacent location
	Slimes
		Every turn each slime will move according to its player AI. Then the map will be updated acording to its commands. Then the 
		next slime in the list will make its move until all slimes have gone.
	Mechanics
		Every turn the map is generated with the current location of all objects on the map, then a slime is slected and passed the 
		map, the slime makes a command based on the player AI, then the map is updated again, this continues until all slimes have 
		moved, then the map is rendered, then the turn ends

		This process continues for 1000 turns then the map is used to calculate the score for each player and a report on the game 
		is generated that outlines the scores of each player, number of slimes, max level slime, number of slimes killed, and number 
		of merges

		Alternetly we could make the game run fully and then save a list or sereis of lists into a new file to allow it to be 
		replayed, this way a large number of games could be run back to back.
