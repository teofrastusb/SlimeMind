Slime Mind

Each slime has the following:
	Attributes
		column - The x location on the map matrix
		row - The y location on the map matrix
		center_x - The x location on the render screen
		center_y - The y location on the render screen
		health - A maximum value based on level, When health = 0 kill off the slime
		attack - A set value based on level, upon success the targets health is reduced by attack value, 
			 this slime will be healed by a small aboutn still based on attack, 1 xp will be earned
		xp - Will be used to calculate level using an exponential equaiton (possible level = roundup(xp^2 - 2*xp + 1))
		level - a number from 1 to 10 that is used to dictate the slimes attributes and end game value
		merge_ready - a boolean for ready to merge, is set to false at the beginning of its turn
