# Introduction
We made this game structure to allow us to write and test AI programs. Each writer will be given a main.py, some example AI codes, and some support .py codes. Writers can use the example code to explore making thier own codes and to run against. As a writer's code  advances they should submit it to be tested against other writers' codes. Evenutally tournaments will be run between all submissions. 

Eventually additional game mechanics may be added, and a new game with the same basic structure but additional mechanics may be released.
